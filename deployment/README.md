# Mezmure AWS deployment

This deployment uses S3 + CloudFront for the Vite client and API Gateway +
Lambda for the Express API. MongoDB remains in Atlas. The AWS provider uses the
`habtamua` profile and `us-west-2`; the CloudFront certificate is created in
`us-east-1` as required by AWS.

Secrets are deliberately not represented as Terraform variables because values
passed through Terraform would be retained in state. Configure `MONGODB_URI` and
`JWT_SECRET` directly on the Lambda after the first apply.

The `.com` redirect should be added only after `mezmure.com` is registered and
delegated. As of 2026-07-21 the registry reports that the domain is not registered.
